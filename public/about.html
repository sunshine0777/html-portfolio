<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I try to be the kind of person others can rely on.
 I care deeply about the people around me, and I always try to listen with an open heart. 
 Being there for my friends, offering comfort or just a quiet presence, is something that means a lot to me.
 I believe in kindness, and I think small gestures can make a big difference.</p>

<p>I’ve been through a lot, and those experiences have made me stronger.
 I don’t give up easily. When life challenges me, I push through — not because it’s easy, but because I know I have the strength to keep going.
 I like to stay focused on my goals and keep growing, even when things get hard.</p>

<p>My friendships are one of the most valuable parts of my life.
 I treasure the deep connections I have, especially with people who really see me for who I am.
 Laughing, talking, or just spending time in silence — it all matters.
 I hope I can continue to be someone who brings peace and strength to the people I care about.</p>
